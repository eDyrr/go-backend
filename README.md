# go-backend

this will contain everything that I learned about backend in golang

well as far as I am in backend, I've learned a couple of technologies such as Caching, Databases, Authentification, APIs ... etc

the main algorithm for a backend application is:

1. turn the app on
2. connect to the server

thats basically it, now if however there's other components included in the app like a database, we need to first connect to it first then turn the server on
